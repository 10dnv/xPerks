# xPerks - great things to the experts

xPerks takes the battle for brains at a whole new level.  

Recognition is made easy with xPerks. Developers & experts are motivated to keep on building, knowing that their efforts can be clearly seen & acknowledged.





## Summary
Connections between companies & experts are facilitated by xPerks. Grooming performance is the heart of sharing recongnition thorught perks.

Adoption is seamless, xPerks can be integrated with any company's account. 
Then, link with personal MultiversX wallet is one click away.

This approach opens a two-steps roadmap of xPerks:

	Step 1 -> 1 to X - where xPerks is provided as SaaS  with focus on recognition & retention for the experts. This will lead to bulk attrition of users.

	Step 2 -> X to X - where xPerks is available as connecting platform for any experts to many companies. 
	


As Perks  tend to align at the fastest rate ever seen, xPerks takes the battle for brains at a new level.  

Step 2 is where the game is changing:
Multi-platform user access with metrics & scores available for both experts & companies. 

This will open a world of possibilities  - will connect business & experts a whole new level using the blockchain as base layer for recognition & attrition.

Link with personal wallet is one click away - it eases scaling & integration - it's worth saying it twice.

There's also a shade of gamification to this approach too. 
Any company internal benefits can be translated in actions & points with xPerks. 
These can then be either staked to win rewards, spent or swapped on any coin within MultiversX environment.
